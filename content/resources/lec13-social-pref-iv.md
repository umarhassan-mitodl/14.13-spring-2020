**Description:**Â This lecture covers field evidence of social preferences, including social preferences in the workplace, policies to increase pro-sociality, and the benefits of pro-sociality.

**Instructor:** Prof. Frank Schilbach

**Note:** In March 2020, MIT students were sent home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and classes were taught virtually. For lecture 12 and 13, Prof. Schilbach continued to teach from the classroom on campus, until he began teaching via Zoom starting at the mid-term review.
