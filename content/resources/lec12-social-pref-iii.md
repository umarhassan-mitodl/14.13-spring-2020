**Description:**Â This lecture continues the discussion of social preferences by taking a deeper dive into games like the Dictator game, among others.

**Instructor:** Prof. Frank Schilbach

**Note:** In March 2020, MIT students were sent home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and classes were taught virtually. For lectures 12 and 13, Prof. Schilbach continued to teach from the classroom on campus, until he began teaching via Zoom starting with the mid-term review.
